    <h1>My Design Manifesto</h1>
    <p id="lineOne">You were with your friends, partying</p>
    <p id="lineTwo">When the alcohol kicked in</p>
    <p id="lineThree">Said you wanted me dead</p>
    <p id="linefour">So, you showed up at my home, all alone</p>
    <p id="linefive">With a shovel and a rose</p>
    <p id="linesix">Do you think I'm a joke?</p>
    <p id="lineseven">'Cause people like <span>you</span> always want back what they can't have</p>
    <p id="lineeight">But I'm past that and you know that</p>
    <p id="linenine">So you should turn back to your outback tellin' 'em trash</p>
    <p id="lineten">Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy and drive you mad</p>
    <p id="lineeleven">That I'm such a stalker, a watcher, a psychopath</p>
    <p id="linetwelve">Then tell them you hate me and dated me just for laughs</p>
    <p id="linethirteen">So, why do you call me and tell me you want me back?</p>
    <p id="linefourteen">You maniac</p>
