        <h1>by Fleetwood Mac</h1>
        <p id="kind">So I'm back to the velvet underground <br>
Back to the floor that I love <br>
To a room with some lace and paper flowers <br>
Back to the gypsy that I was <br>
To the gypsy that I was <br>
<br>            
And it all comes down to you <br>
Well, you know that it does, well <br>
Lightning strikes maybe once, maybe twice <br>
Oh and it lights up the night <br>
And you see your gypsy <br>
You see your gypsy <br>
<br>
To the gypsy <br>
That remains <br>
Her face says freedom <br>
With a little fear <br>
I have no fear <br>
I have only love <br>
And if I was a child <br>
And the child was enough <br>
Enough for me to love <br>
Enough to love <br>
<br>
She is dancing away from you now <br>
She was just a wish <br>
She was just a wish <br>
And her memory is all that is left for you now <br>
You see your gypsy, oh <br>
You see your gypsy <br>
<br>
Ooh ooh, oh oh, oh oh oh <br>
<br>
Goodness strikes <br>
Maybe once, maybe twice <br>
And it all comes down to you <br>
Ooh oh, and it all comes down to you <br>
Lightning strikes <br>
Maybe once, maybe twice (oh) <br>
I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes <br>
(And it all comes down to you)</p>
