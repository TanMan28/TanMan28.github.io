        <h3>Broadway Rallies Behind Biden Ahead of Election Day <br><br>
        <id>by Caitlin Huston</id></h3>

            <div><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/broadwaybrands/image/upload/f_auto,g_auto,w_696,h_538,c_fill/v1/broadway-news/2020/10/29115901/Broadway-for-Biden_Emilio-Madrid_-39.jpg"></div>
            The Broadway community traditionally rallies behind political causes and presidential elections. 
<br><br>
But during this election season, with the industry shut down, a pandemic raging and unemployment affecting nearly all theater workers, the community has come together with a heightened passion for politics. Industry members have created new grassroots political organizations and organized phone-banking events and fundraisers for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden — a candidate many view as crucial to the survival of the industry. 
            <br><br>
            Halle Morse, an actor, producer and management consultant, began Broadway for Biden in May, after seeing an appetite for political involvement among theater artists. Since its founding, the volunteer-run organization has hosted weekly and now biweekly phone-banking events, in partnership with several Broadway actors. The group has made over 23,000 phone calls, reaching more than 3,500 voters. 
<br><br>
“This has been something that I think always our industry is focused on, but even more so during the pandemic, during the economic crisis and race relations in this country,” Morse said. “People are motivated and are willing to donate their time.”
<br><br>
The organization has also hosted digital town halls featuring Broadway industry members on issues such as unemployment and health care and organized a large-scale concert fundraiser, “In Our America,” to benefit the Biden campaign. 
<br><br>
Another like-minded organization, Producing Blue, which was formed by producers Victoria Weinberg and Hayley Isaacson, has been curating a weekly newsletter that includes action steps to take during the election and links to other political events within the community. The group has also partnered with actor Erika Henningsen in an effort to register first-time voters.
